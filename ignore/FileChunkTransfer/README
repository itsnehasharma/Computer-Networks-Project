in order to test this part, 

run java server then java client 

the program will start asking for starting bytes, ending bytes. 
this is to simulate message passing which we don't have implemented yet. 

in order to use this:

in the client terminal FIRST, enter starting bytes and ending bytes. for example
starting bytes: 0
ending bytes: 64

THEN, in the server terminal, do the same.
starting bytes: 0
ending bytes: 64

each terminal will ask for "quit?" in which you enter 
false if you want to continue 
true if you're done

note that you have to change "fileSize" in "bufferedOutputStream.write(finalFileInBytes,0,fileSize);" (line 38) to match the highest byte you transfered. in this example that would be 64.
the fully or partially transfered file is under "received.txt"
